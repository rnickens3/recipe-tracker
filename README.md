# recipe-tracker
This project demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript objects, arrays, and basic data processing methods by modeling and analyzing a collection of recipes.

## What I Learned
* How to create and manipulate objects and arrays in JavaScript
* How to use array methods like reduce, length, and push
* How to write and use functions to process and update object properties
* How to access and update object properties dynamically

## Methods Used
* Object Creation: Each recipe is represented as an object with properties such as name, ingredients, cookingTime, ratings, and more.
* Array Storage: All recipe objects are stored in a single recipes array for easy management.
* reduce: Used to calculate the average rating from an array of numbers.
* length: Used to count the number of ingredients in each recipe.
* Conditional Logic: Used to determine the difficulty level based on cooking time.
* Property Assignment: Functions are used to calculate and assign values directly to object properties (e.g., averageRating, totalIngredients, difficultyLevel).
